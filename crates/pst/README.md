# outlook-pst

Reimplement the Outlook PST store provider in Rust.

The PST file format is publicly documented in the [MS-PST](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_file_formats/ms-pst/141923d5-15ab-4ef1-a524-6dce75aae546) open specification. Data structures and type names generally mimic the concepts and names in that document, with some adjustment for readability and to match Rust language conventions. As much as possible, everything in this crate should have a deep link to the documentation it is based on in the doc comments.
